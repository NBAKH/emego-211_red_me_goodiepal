(((Ahhh sorry my English is in written-form = not perfect, but please relax, it’s not my first languages….)))

##Is this a real Editions Mego Release??
??? - You have to ask (Peter Rehberg)[http://alchetron.com/Peter-Rehberg-357304-W], about this — not me…

Do I need a introduction??
Well Goodiepal - be the name then…

Crackle & Pop's???
A LOT OF people think that these files (emego 211) is VINYL RIP's ----- but no no, we use artificial vinyl software, like the once you will find by following this link: ——

A record store & Who is in the grooves...
These Editions Mego vinyl - records (w. catalog number's EMEGO 211) - is only physically available from Kihoskh in Copenhagen, were I run a small record store - everything I sell is sold cheaper then the manufacture price… AND a lot of it is from my own collection —you need to visit the shop, - no post order or anything like that. ----- the records is used as a distribution form, for a lot of texts I have written on & about - modern music - whits I sneak into the records sleeves…Uhh… - The information on who dos what on the files / records is written into these writings, and they will be to complex to mention here, but cool people is in the files believe me..!

Were can I find Kihoskh?
I did an advertisement in the wire last year, I THINK YOU can find it here:

-It is some friends and mainly one friend called Bjarke Svendsen who runs the account … (THANK YOU --- Bjarke & the rest of you..!)
((P.S. I hope that one day the account is deleted, but that is not my table))

Goodiepal lectures...
I currently lectures almost every week at the National Gallery of Denmark - That's for free or almost free…(usually 2,- Danish kronner) - And if you ask before the lecture stars it can be held in Norwegian, Danish, broken-Faroish or English, depending on your preferences… — Lectures will generally be announced here:  www.facebook.com/pages/Goodiepal/112212125662 

Were can I find side: E.F. & G.H. online? 
Side: E-F-G &-H is missing by purpose, but you can email one of my favorite artists in Mexico and ASK if he will upload a RIP ((—CONTACT: https://es-la.facebook.com/losmacuanos ))  Side  -- G & H is in the hands of my favorite youtube'er: www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Ry9yW1da8 — If you ask him kindly, he will surly upload a RIP for you somewhere. --- If none of this works out try the EMEGO—BOSS --- www.facebook.com/prehberg.emego?ref=ts&fref=ts

Why is there 15 LP's when there was original announced 14??
I personally hate when things add up, hove about you? - There might even be some more records in the future w. side's correlating to the Faroese Alphabet…

What kind of music are you listening to at the moment??
Bigitte Alsted - It is an obsession…

Icelandic animated notation
Most composer's in Scandinavia hates it and want nothing to do whit the subject - but we love it, and I think it's basically only people connected to --- www.slatur.is --- In one way or another who rocks it, and therefore we can talk about a scene of some sort. --- http://cramer.pleintekst.nl/goodiepal-icelandic_notation/download.html

Still V/Vm??
Yes always… I am born out of V/Vm… (V/Vm, Poul Erik Vei(j)gaard & Tordis Berstrand)

Making money on hosting these files…( In Your dreams…)
NO YOU WILL NOT..! - But let’s say that you make a little bit of money for file-hosting on a YOUTUBE channel, or that kind   — That kind of money is peanuts, you should spend them on coffee for yourself, if you make a lot, you can spend it on coffee for me as well, and if you make a groteque amount of cash, you can supply my whole family whit coffee..! Now hove about that??

Theatre
Yes ---- https://teatertugt.wordpress.com/  - But not manny Scandinavians hits the theatre on a regular, whit is s shame… bla. bla. bla. Nynne Roberta Pedersen Pedersen is founding member of Teater Tugt - they are some of the best around, and very active… VERY GOOD!!

Why is there old & NEW music in the grooves??
Well as a start I think that time is a illusion, and my albums has always been like that, some old some new… It's better that way… BUT you have never heard any of this files before anyway, so let’s not spend to much time writing about this…

Well you can hear that on side A-B and Ø-Å of this FILES we are offering you at this webpage… or the actual vinyls located in kihoskh (…see above…)

Next level music instruments 2016
For me everything build by Tara Pattenden is RAD, it's simpler then most, but I do think that you can create far more musical sounds whit a bit of inventiveness, then the biggest euro-rack-system you could ever imagine, I have a great love for Tara's work bout as a artist and as a music-instrument-maker, some cool dudes — will make fun of the simpleness of things, but GET OUT, Tara rocks… www.facebook.com/fantomchips/
(( Bonus INFO — Nynne Roberta Pedersen Pedersen rocks a Lerango Drone - called a Mermaid ))

GENGE?
Yes!

											Zoroastrianism

Whits synthetic-instrument is mainly used on this recordings?
— Hmmm, let me think there is a lot of music… JEP!  this will be the one: www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wyUAdwy624 - That is an all time classic, and one of the most interesting synths out there… I am so happy to own one and I often lead it out to other people in Copenhagen record and use it… (( MY SYNTH collection is your synth-collection)) —— I have written a lot about some of Jomox’s more esoteric machines in the papers sneaked into my records as mentioned above… ——

Yes do not fear! - not even this one: www.gearslutz.com/board/7667707-post70.html COMPUTER music has always been about imitation, and the twisting of that…

Moog Mother-32?
Be careful, I have just tried one out at a friends house — Ahhhh you end-up sounding like all the other synth-kids… it’s more scary then Teenage Engineering devices.. - please think about it before you move in on the MOOG… http://www.rad-dudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nt9mjarm2kc9nozhmdmnvvgso1_500.jpg

I am deeply sorry but I can't spend my time on that… I do recognize it as a super informative database, and I really really don't like my profile picture there, but I do not have an account - so it's impossible for me to change ——If you by any change would update it, I would be super happy… (( Thank you in advance… ))

STEIM
Everybody talks about EMS in Stockholm, but STEIM once did there own synthesizer-system, they are just so bad at telling there stories, hmmmm - basically there is no stories to tell since STEIM's magic died out many years ago… Was STEIM ever alive??? - I hope it was… Will it ever come back???? - Well that is up to you, it could be Europe's finest but needs urgent new blood… There old in-house SYNTH---SYSTEM is full of wonderful and action-packed original ideas in how to do modular music, but all the modules is currently just lying around… ------ If you are young and full of energy please EXPLORE..!

True Faith
I do think that when you get over 35 years of age, it is time to stop talking politics, I mean you have lesser time on this planet then the younger once who is around… - It is time to start to concentrate on how to leave this life, Religion, Believe-systems and POLITICS,  should go hand in hand, there is way to little moral and thoughts about death in todays debate about leading this world ------- RIGHT wing or left… Pro-environmental, or computer bla. bla. capitalist or Anti-Human… Faith, Religion and ideas about death is greatly missed, in politics today...
